                    a specific business problem. He or she is a master project manager with 
                    high level experience, which a business may not have internally, and can 
                    manage an organisation through a period of change and transformation.

                    period of 6-12 months, or may bring longer term senior executive experience 
                    into an organisation on a part time basis.
